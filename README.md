# final_project_ironhack

# This project was made for a company, that for confidentiality issues, should not be named. The aim of this company is to certify other companies, by benchmarking their HR policies, as a good place to work.

# I've analysed, in time available (one week), 7 different dataframes, some of them with 2.5M rows and more than 100 columns, which required some computational power and serious data cleaning skills.

# I've also built a model, using Decision Tree Classifier, to predict the success of a certification process.

# Again, due to confidentiality issues, I cannot share the datasets used and I had to clean the outputs of my notebooks. I share some of the code used in this project and the final presentation (Tableu Public).

# I'm also sharing the link where I made my 7 clocked minutes presentation to my colleagues, teachers and the HR Certifying Company Representative.
